# DataFilm movie Database

This project is a sophisticated software system that grants movie enthusiasts access to a wealth of information about movies and individuals within the film industry. Notably, users can explore a feature that showcases the top-rated movies from each decade, starting from the 70s. In the comprehensive movie details, users can also find information about the individuals involved in the production, as well as discover a list of other movies in which those individuals have participated. Furthermore, users have the ability to create distinct lists of movies, which they can easily manage and share with others should they choose to do so.
